This will convert SillyTavern RP logs to ShareGPT logs and then you can have them all merged into one big file. 

# How to merge into one big file

Place all files into one folder, open a terminal shell in the folder and install "pip install pandas pyarrow" then in line 26 of the python file which you can modify with VScode or another IDE or text editor, remove ":\Users\Mia\Downloads\test" and replace with the location to your directory of all your ShareGPT files, then run with python scriptP.py and it will output a .json file and a parquet file.
